GROUP THREE TASK MANAGER WEBSITE


Problem Statement
Many individuals struggle with managing their daily tasks and responsibilities efficiently. Without an
organized system, tasks can easily be overlooked or mismanaged, leading to reduced productivity and
increased stress. There is a need for an inclusive, user-friendly website that helps individuals effectively
organize, prioritize, and track their tasks. Additionally, user preferences for light or dark mode
interfaces can significantly impact their overall experience.


Solution
To tackle these challenges, We propose developing the Task Manager website, a robust task
management tool designed to provide a smooth user experience for task organization. The website will
feature a secure login system and allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks, set deadlines, and
categorize tasks by project or group. Users will have the ability to track the status and progress of their
tasks ie completed,in progress and also set priorities from highest to lowest, ensuring important tasks
are prioritized. The platform will include options for both light and dark mode to cater to user
preferences. Additionally, the website will offer advanced filtering and sorting features to help users
efficiently manage their tasks and stay organized. The website responsiveness will be improved to also
accommodate different devices.
