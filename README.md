### GROUP THREE TASK MANAGER WEBSITE

Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with managing their daily tasks and responsibilities efficiently. Without an organized system, tasks can easily be overlooked or mismanaged, leading to reduced productivity and increased stress. There is a need for an inclusive, user-friendly website that helps individuals effectively organize, prioritize, and track their tasks. Additionally, user preferences for light or dark mode interfaces can significantly impact their overall experience.

Solution

To address these challenges, we propose developing the Task Manager website, a robust task management tool designed to provide a smooth user experience for task organization. The website will feature a secure login system and allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks, set deadlines, and categorize tasks by project or group. Users will have the ability to track the status and progress of their tasks (i.e., completed, in progress) and set priorities from highest to lowest, ensuring important tasks are prioritized. The platform will include options for both light and dark mode to cater to user preferences. Additionally, the website will offer advanced filtering and sorting features to help users efficiently manage their tasks and stay organized. The website's responsiveness will be improved to accommodate different devices.
